At the time, I had already read a big pile of Wallace's work, which included a lot of short fiction. But I read Infinite Jest in a matter of days. I've told stories ever since, because it was so quickly and immediately and totally convincing that I believed it was true.\\n\\nThere's an enormous irony when you think about how much of a mainstream book you'd been expecting to receive.
